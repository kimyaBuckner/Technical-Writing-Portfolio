## About this portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub writing portfolio! 

As a seasoned software engineer with over four years of experience, I've woven technical documentation into my career as a coder by documenting APIs, developing and sustaining reference materials for engineering processes, and creating onboarding documentation.
