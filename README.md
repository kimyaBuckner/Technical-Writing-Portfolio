Welcome to my GitHub writing portfolio! 

As a seasoned software engineer with over four years of experience, I've woven technical documentation into my career as a coder by documenting APIs, developing and sustaining reference materials for engineering processes, and creating onboarding documentation. Prioritizing documentation throughout the lifecycle of the engineering process helps transform complex concepts into accessible ideas.

This portfolio provides a few samples of technical documentation I have produced following the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).
