# Create a branch within your GitHub repository

This article describes how to create a branch within your GitHub repository. Branches isolate development work from existing branches in the repository. Branches provide an environment for changes to be made and tested independently of the source branch. Using branches in a repository lets multiple developers work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. A branch can be created from any existing branch. Typically a branch is created from the repository's default branch.

### Creating a branch from the branch overview
1. Navigate to the main page of your repository.
2. Select the ![Branch symbol icon](https://github.com/kimyaBuckner/Technical-Writing-Portfolio/assets/7422907/86a3cb60-3afc-48c3-a011-02857ded30fe) branch drop-down menu to expand the branch overview.
