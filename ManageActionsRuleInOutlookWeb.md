# Manage message rules using Outlook web

A rule is an automated action that Outlook performs on incoming or outgoing emails. Rules allow you to organize, filter, and process messages automatically based on specified criteria. You can create rules to move incoming emails to specific folders, delete emails that meet certain conditions, forward emails to another address, and more.

## Create a rule

1. At the top of the page, select **Settings** ![gear icon](Images/setting.png).
2. Select **Mail** > **Rules**.
3. Select **Add new rule**.
4. In the rule name box, enter a rule name.
5. Under **Add a condition**, select the conditions you want a message to satisfy for the rule to be applied.
6. Under **Add an action**, select the action you want to be performed on the message.
7. Optionally, select **Add an exception**, if you want to indicate any exceptions to this rule.

> **Note:** Rules will only automatically operate on messages as they are received. To run a newly created rule on messages that are already in the **Inbox**, navigate to the rule by following steps one and two above and select **Run rule now**.
